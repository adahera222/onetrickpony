Needed extra libraries:
- Lua 5.1 (**NOT 5.2!**)
- SDL 2.0 (**NOT 1.2!** although support for that might happen)
- GLEW (pretty much any version should do, I'm using 1.6.0)
- ZLib (if you don't have this, you should probably get it)
- JACK (optional, but HIGHLY RECOMMENDED because PULSEAUDIO FUCKING SUCKS)
  - If you'd like to disable this: make NO_JACK=1

The game code is ZLib-licensed (in game/).
